# project statement
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem



# about the dataset
--the SIGNS dataset is a collection of 6 signs representing numbers from 0 to 5.

## steps
- building a conv skelton. find it in file **'Building Convolution model from scratch.ipynb'**

- using `forward_propagation` function below to build the following model: `CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED`.

- Model functions 
1. create placeholders
2. initialize parameters
3. forward propagate
4. compute the cost
5. create an optimizer
