# about the problem:
--build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats with a **Neural Network mindset**.


# about the dataset:
**given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:**

- a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
- a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).


## steps used:
--Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    -Initializing parameters
    -Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    -Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
--Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
